# Assignment 3

This site was plenty fun while I was working on it. However, it seems like the more links you try to work with on your site, the more likely things are going to go wrong.
The biggest headache ended up being the image links/sources. I'm not sure if I made a spelling error at some point, but none of the images would load. Eventually I just rewrote all of the images and link code directly in the github repository.

In the end it is super satisfying to see my site working properly.
I'm just glad I don't have hypertension...

Looking forward to CSS
