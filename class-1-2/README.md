# Week 1.2 Poem Formatting assignment

[ My version ](https://danandcook.github.io/class-1-2)

This week's assignment went pretty well. I had fun sorting through a ton of short poems. I chose [ _"Wanna be a Fish"_ ](http://img.bhs4.com/9A/B/9AB0AF17804A5F589E78B76449F7BC47D192CFEE_lis.jpg) by David Klenda, because I thought the poem structure was funny and clever. Figuring out the text spacing was kinda tricky though. I started out using fifty quadrillion single-space entities, and just sort of eye-balling the distances between the text. I looked into a faster/more efficient way to space out text, but the method reccomended used CSS.

 I found out that there are different versions of the "non-breaking space" entity. 
 
 For example the single-space entity is **&nbsp**
 
 The double-space entity is **&ensp**
 
 And the quadruple-space entity is **&emsp**
 

The larger spaces made the poem structuring a lot faster and easier.
I am looking forward to starting CSS.
