# Homework 4
Ho nelly, this one took me a while.
The back and fourth between the html and css files got pretty confusing. 
I do like the flexability of css though. There seem to be multiple ways of achieving similar effects (eg. color & font size).
It's also neat how free-form and unstructured the css files are. 
I suppose that poses its own risks, but it's less daunting when each style element can stand on its own 

I'm not sure if my hosted font is working though.
